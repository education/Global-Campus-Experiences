# Global-Campus-Experiences
This is a guide to Global Campus Experiences and how learners can approach incorporating them into your learning journey.

We’ve expanded how we think about Experiences within the Global Campus ecosystem to support both its evolution and variety of types of offerings for better navigation of resources. Below is a guide to our Experiences and how you may want to approach incorporating them into your learning journey.

## Experiences
Experiences in Global Campus are curated learning resources designed for Global Campus learners. Content is accessible only once a student is verified and a student coupon is applied to their account.

## Experience Categories
You may have noticed small labels in the new design of the Experience pages that say things like ‘Primer’ or ‘Tools’. These are our Experience categories. Each serving a slightly different purpose.
